# Installation
Follow the instructions from [here](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=200320#msg8158307). Under step 5 simply choose what code you want from bellow instead of the example provided on that page.

# Anime list
```
@import "https://rawgit.com/RaitaroH/MyAnimeList/master/MAL.css";
@import "https://rawgit.com/RaitaroH/MyAnimeList/master/Anime-specific.css";
@import "https://rawgit.com/RaitaroH/MyAnimeList/master/Covers.css";
#copyright
{
visibility: visible;}
```

# Manga list
```
@import "https://rawgit.com/RaitaroH/MyAnimeList/master/MAL.css";
@import "https://rawgit.com/RaitaroH/MyAnimeList/master/Manga-specific.css";
#copyright
{
visibility: visible;}
```
# Customization - no import
In case you do want to customize then you will have to use the code as is and NOT import it.

Under MAL.css, at the top, under root, color variables and image variables for the banner and background can easily be changed to meet your tastes. Is that simple.
